Q1)Building Bridges: Consider a 2-D map with a horizontal river passing through its center. There are n cities on the southern bank with x-coordinates a(1) … a(n) and n cities on the northern bank with x-coordinates b(1) … b(n). You want to connect as many north-south pairs of cities as possible with bridges such that no two bridges cross. When connecting cities, you can only connect city i on the northern bank to city i on the southern bank.

Q2) given the x,y,z coordinates of a billion stars (basically the entire array can’t fit in the RAM) calculate the k closest.
Answer -> use a max heap that contains the k minimum distances.
Time-> n(log k)
then the question was changed to -> now that we have several computers which can combine to fit the entire set of stars, how will you then solve it?
